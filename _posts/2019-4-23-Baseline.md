The time has finally come for the first big step: the baseline demo.

Velostat has proven to be a very difficult material to work with. It took several nights of trying to get sensible readings from different sized pieces of the material until we finally discovered a key for Velostat: to get good readings, we had to fold the velostat over two or three times. Once we did that, we could finally see observable differences between when we applied pressure versus when we left it alone.

Found out in lecture today about capacitive sensors that are simple and detect whether something is on top or not. Soldering a wire to the sensor was a bit of a nightmare, but some heat shrink helped save the day. As of now, we can tell whether or not something is on top of the sensor: when we press on it, the reading is ~0.95+, and when nothing is on it, the reading is roughly 0.25 or below. Next step is to get a grid of these sensors working and come up with a way to categorize head orientations based on the sensor readings!
